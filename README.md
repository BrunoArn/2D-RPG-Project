# 2D-RPG-Project

This is a 2D top-down game developed in Unity, primarily focused on exploring and implementing game feel techniques and advanced use of the Unity Editor alongside C# scripting.

The project includes multiple enemy types, bullet hell patterns, and interactable scenery elements. It serves as a learning-focused environment to experiment with responsive gameplay mechanics, efficient editor tooling, and scalable architecture.
